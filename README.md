# Vocabulary Builder

## Overview
The Vocabulary Builder is a Python script designed to analyze books in various formats (epub, mobi, pdf) and identify the most challenging wordsâ€”those you might not be familiar with. The script then generates markdown files containing these words, facilitating an efficient way to learn and expand your vocabulary.

## Features
- Supports epub, mobi, and pdf formats.
- Identifies difficult words based on a chosen criteria.
- Creates markdown files for easy learning and reference.
